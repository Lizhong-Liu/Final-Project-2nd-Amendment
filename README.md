* The code used can be seen in [Final Code](https://github.com/camilacd/Final-Project-2nd-Amendment/blob/master/Mass%20Shootings%20and%20Social%20Media.ipynb)

* The first proposal submitted on October 31st is described in [First Proposal](https://github.com/camilacd/Final-Project-2nd-Amendment/blob/master/Proposal_Oct31.pdf). At first, the idea was to focus on Las Vegas shooting, but it was changed to the Texas shooting due to data availability.

IN SUMMARY:

#**1. What are the effects of the Texas Shooting on social media and financial markets?**

In this work we want to assess how an extreme event -like a shooting- affects the discussion about the right to bear arms in U.S. and how it relates with gun stocks. We will characterize tweets evolution regarding the 2nd Amendment, perform a Sentiment Analysis in Twitter assessing if some significant changes occur in the aftermath of the Texas shooting and finally we will study the correlation between the tweets and gun stock prices. 

#**2. Sources**

Twitter database
- We use the streaming API, that allows to filter through tweets in real time.  
- Query: "2nd amendment" + "Second amendment".
- Total amount of tweets: 166.610.
- Dates: Nov, 1st 2017 16:00 - Nov, 7th 2017 07:00.
- More information: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview.html

Yahoo Finance database (* these are some examples of guns stocks)
- Sturm Ruger (RGR)
- Standard and Poor's 500 - S&P 500 (SPX)

#**3. Analysis**

- **PART 1: Analysis over Tweets on 2nd Amendment and Gun Control**

In this section, we analyze the number of tweets over the time, characteristics of twitter users and the content of the tweets. In it, the data shows how the number of tweets started increasing just after the shooting in Nov. 5th and had several peaks during Nov. 6th to later dramatically decreased in 7th of Nov.

One remarkable and unexpected outcome of project was the analysis of the most active twitter users, in which is possible to observe that the top 10 most active users are fake accounts (bots), designed to spread pro-gun messages or promote the membership and support to the National Rifle Association (NRA). It is difficult to estimate the number of fake accounts created for this propose, nevertheless according to the text analysis 112,55 tweets contained the word “NRA”.

In the other side, the most retweeted tweed (63,365 RT) presents an anti-gun rights position. This single tweet represented around the 38% of the total number of tweets in our study.

One of the limitations that we found was the impossibility to track the geographical location of the twitter users. This difficulty derives that the fact that many users do not report their location or report fictional locations. Better information about the location of the users would had allowed us to explore the presence of geographical relation with and pro or anti-gun rights attitude or link this relation with a specific political preference. Additionally, the keywords used for the search of tweets - "2nd amendment" + "Second amendment"- do not represent all positions in twitter and they usually represent comments of the most conservative side of the discussion. We would have liked to extend the search to different queries, like "gun control" but the timing did not allow us to do it. 

- **PART 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter**

Using the library **TextBlob**, we classified the tweets in positive, negative and neutral. 
We found that on average 19.57% was positive, 10.74% was negative and 69.68% was neutral. We plotted the number of tweets under each category to see their evolution. It should be highlighted that these results should be intepreted carefully since those classifiers are not always accurate and they have some limitations when irony, or other complex structures are in place.   Finally, using the library **Wordcloud** we tried to plot the most common words, but we're unable to retrieve the result. 

- **PART 3: Analysis of the gun stock market in the aftermath of the shooting in Texas**

In this section we explore the behavior of the gun stock prices around the period of the mass shooting in Texas and Las Vegas. For this purpose, we will use the stock price of one of the most important gun companies in the US- RGR and we will try to find how the mass shooting impacted its stock's price. In our analysis we did not find evidence that a mass shooting has an impact on the price of RGR. We do find that the gun stock market responds to the context of the overall market rather than to an event of shooting.

It is important to note that we will only use graphical analysis to study this correlation. Our initial approach was to explore if the volume of tweets related to the Mass shooting in Texas was a determinant of the price of the stock RGR. However, we did not have enough hourly data on the stock's price (since the stock market trades only 7 hours a day) and we only had 2 days of tweets data after the shooting.
